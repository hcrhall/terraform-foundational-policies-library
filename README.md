# Terraform Foundational Policies Library

This repository contains a library of policies that can be used within Terraform Cloud to accelerate your adoption of policy as code. To learn more about the Sentinel language and framework, review the Sentinel [documentation](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/).

## Prerequisites

↥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

Before you start adopting some of the policies within this library, it is recommended that you do the following:

1. [Install](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/intro/getting-started/install/) the Sentinel CLI. The CLI is an excellent tool for familiarizing yourself with the internals of Sentinel and allows you to `apply` and `test` policies outside of the Terraform platform. You can find more information related to the Sentinel CLI in the [Enforce Policy with Sentinel](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/policy-quickstart?in=terraform/cloud-get-started) learning track.

3. Enable the _Governance and Policy Plan_ in Terraform Cloud.
4. Have access to a [supported](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/vcs/index.html#supported-vcs-providers) version control system (VCS) provider.

> **NOTE:** The Governance and Policy Plan is a _paid_ plan in Terraform Cloud. You can learn more about changing your payment plan by reviewing the [Changing Your Payment Plan](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/paid.html#changing-your-payment-plan) sections in the Terraform Cloud documentation.

## Documentation

↥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

The file and directory structure within this repository has been designed to have a descriptive `ROOT` directory that contains all policies that are related to a given standard. As an example, all policies for the Center for Internet Security Benchmarks are all located within the `cis` directory. Policies are then broken down by cloud service provider (i.e. AWS, Azure and GCP) and then categorized by cloud service (i.e. Compute, Databases, Networking etc.)

```ruby
.
└── ROOT
    └── CLOUD
       └── CATEGORY
           └── POLICY
               └── ...
```

All `CATEGORY` related directories contain a single `README.md` that details all information that is required to assess and enforce a policy in Terraform Cloud. This information includes:
- Policy name
- Description of the controls that are evaluated
- The Policy Set configuration that needs to be added to the `sentinel.hcl` file.

> **Note:** You can find a full list of all available policies in the [Policy Guides](#policy-guides) section.

## Setup & Integration

↥ [back to top](#table-of-contents)

Before you can use any of the policies within this library, you will need to configure Terraform Cloud. The following sections detail the high-level steps required to deploy a policy from the foundational policies library. The [Enforce Policy with Sentinel](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform?track=sentinel#sentinel) learning track covers the end-to-end process in greater detail. If this is the first time you are setting up a Sentinel policy, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with this track prior to continuing further.

### Version Control System (VCS)
Terraform Cloud provides first-class support for VCS integration. This allows VCS repositories to contain all of the policies and configuration needed to manage Sentinel policy at scale. [Integrating with VCS](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/getting-started/policies.html#integrating-with-vcs) is as simple as:

1. [Connect a VCS Provider to Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/vcs/index.html)
1. Create a repository in your VCS provider that will be used as the source of your Policy Set configuration
1. Clone the source repository to a local directory

### Policy Set Configuration

Once the VCS is integrated with Terraform Cloud, start to configure your Terraform Policy Set as follows:

1. Identifying a policy from the foundational policies library that should be enforced on a Terraform [Workspace](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/workspaces/index.html)
1. Review the policy documentation and copy the configuration snippet for the policy of choice.
1. Create a `sentinel.hcl` configuration file within the local directory for your repository.
1. Edit the contents of the `sentinel.hcl` by pasting the configuration snippet into the body of the configuration file.
1. Commit your changes to your local repository content and then use the `git push` command to upload the changes to your remote repository.

> **Example Snippet**
>
> ```hcl
>policy "gcp-cis-7.1-kubernetes-ensure-stackdriver-logging-is-set-to-enabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters" {
>    source = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/terraform-foundational-policies-library/master/cis/gcp/kubernetes/>gcp-cis-7.1-kubernetes-ensure-stackdriver-logging-is-set-to-enabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters/gcp-cis-7.>1-kubernetes-ensure-stackdriver-logging-is-set-to-enabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters.sentinel"
>    enforcement_level = "advisory"
>}
>
>policy "gcp-cis-7.2-kubernetes-ensure-stackdriver-monitoring-is-set-to-enabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters" {
>    source = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/terraform-foundational-policies-library/master/cis/gcp/kubernetes/>gcp-cis-7.2-kubernetes-ensure-stackdriver-monitoring-is-set-to-enabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters/gcp-cis-7.>2-kubernetes-ensure-stackdriver-monitoring-is-set-to-enabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters.sentinel"
>    enforcement_level = "advisory"
>}
>
>policy "gcp-cis-7.3-kubernetes-ensure-legacy-authorization-is-set-to-disabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters" {
>    source = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashicorp/terraform-foundational-policies-library/master/cis/gcp/kubernetes/>gcp-cis-7.3-kubernetes-ensure-legacy-authorization-is-set-to-disabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters/gcp-cis-7.>3-kubernetes-ensure-legacy-authorization-is-set-to-disabled-on-kubernetes-engine-clusters.sentinel"
>    enforcement_level = "advisory"
>}
>
>...
>```


### Policy Set Management

Now that the Policy Set is configured, it is time to enforce this configuration on a Terraform Cloud workspace. This is achieved by:

1. Browsing to your Terraform Cloud organization settings

![policy-sets-navigate-1](./images/policy-sets-navigate-1.png)

2. Browse to Policy Sets settings

![policy-sets-navigate-2](./images/policy-sets-navigate-2.png)

3. Connect a new Policy Set

![policy-sets-navigate-3](./images/policy-sets-navigate-3.png)

4. Configure the Policy Settings (i.e. name, source, path, branch & workspace scope) and apply the settings

![policy-sets-create](./images/policy-sets-create.png)

To test the configuration, navigate to the target workspace and queue a new plan. The policy check phase should now appear in the run details, and see the newly created policy will execute and return the state of the policy evaluation (i.e. `Pass` or `Fail`).

The image below shows the output of an example policy evaluation:
